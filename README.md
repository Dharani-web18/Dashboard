#DASHBOARD

STEPS TO LOCALLY RUN THE APPLICATION :

#Step 1: Ensure you have installed Node.js on your system, or install it from the official website

#Step 2: Start the Development Server
To start your application locally (Run this command in Visual Studio): npm start

This command will launch a development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000/


#Step 3: Accessing the Web Application Locally
URL: http://localhost:3000/

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
You will see the React application running with live reloading, meaning any changes you make to the code will automatically reflect in the browser.
